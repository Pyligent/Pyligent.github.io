#### Use two Deep learning models to Classify the image from Fashion-MNIST dataset

- Basic Model (fully connected layer model)

- Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)

All model will use the Keras framework with R implementation 

#### ![Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data
)

- 60000 images for training and 10000 images for testing
- Each example is a 28x28 gray-scale image, associated with a label from 10 classes 
0 T-shirt/top,1 Trouser, 2 Pullover, 3 Dress, 4 Coat, 5 Sandal,6 Shirt, 7 Sneaker, 8 Bag ,9 Ankle bootÂ 

- The dataset is CSV format. The detailed format is label, pixel1, pixel2, pixel3, ... pixel784. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total
